# Hallo, Wie geht’s?

👋 Hi there! I attend by **oliveira-sh**. On this corner of the internet, you'll discover my explorations in:

- **Networking**: From protocols to packet crafting.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Kernel hacks and OS building blocks.
- **Cybersecurity**: hacking, pentesting, and purple teaming.
- **Data Science**: Data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.

I code somethiings.
