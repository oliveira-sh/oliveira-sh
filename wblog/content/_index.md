## root@debian:/home/anon# `cat whoami.rs | grep anon | less`

```rust
pub struct anon {
    nickname: &'static str = "oliveira-sh";
    languages: Vec<&'static str> = vec!["🇧🇷", "🇬🇧", "🇩🇪"];
    interests: Vec<&'static str> = vec![
        "🐶 Dogs",
        "🎮 Gaming",
        "📚 Reading",
        "₿ Cryptocurrency's",
    ];
}
```
